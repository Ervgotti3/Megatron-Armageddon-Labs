Verification CLI (students must prove all 3 requirements)
1) “VPC is only reachable via CloudFront”
A) Direct ALB access should fail (403)
  curl -I https://<ALB_DNS_NAME>

Expected: 403 (blocked by missing header)

B) CloudFront access should succeed
  curl -I https://chewbacca-growl.com
  curl -I https://app.chewbacca-growl.com

Expected: 200/301 → 200

2) WAF moved to CloudFront
  aws wafv2 get-web-acl \
  --name <project>-cf-waf01 \
  --scope CLOUDFRONT \
  --id <WEB_ACL_ID>

And confirm distribution references it:
  aws cloudfront get-distribution \
  --id <DISTRIBUTION_ID> \
  --query "Distribution.DistributionConfig.WebACLId"

Expected: WebACL ARN present.

3) chewbacca-growl.com points to CloudFront
  dig chewbacca-growl.com A +short
  dig app.chewbacca-growl.com A +short

Expected: resolves to CloudFront (you’ll see CloudFront anycast behavior, not ALB IPs)
